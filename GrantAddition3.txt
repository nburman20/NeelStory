The Dragon left the castle after the knight did in search for a trainer. Walking through the forest, the dragon was at a lost, "Who could help me?" he sighed. 

Suddenly, the dragon heard someone punching through trees. He peered at the mysterious man and saw, Rocky Balboa. Rocky's senses tingled and he spun behind him, "Who's there!"

"Oh it is just me Mr. Balboa! I am but a weak dragon, and I need your help!" Rocky looked into the sad eyes of the dragon, he knew he was telling the truth. The dragon told the

whole tale to Rocky of the murdeous knight who slayed all of his friends. He took off his boxing gloves and shook the dragons hand swearing to train him.
