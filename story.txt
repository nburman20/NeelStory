The main obstacles being the ogre and the witch. Bill ended up beating them with little effort and went on to slay the dragon. Bill thought he had killed the dragon, but actually the dragon was still alive. The dragob knew that right know he wasnt strong enought to defeat Bill, so he pretended to be dead. The dragon decided that he would train for several years in order to defeat Bill someday."The Dragon left the castle after the knight did in search for a trainer. Walking through the forest, the dragon was at a lost, "Who could help me?" he sighed. Suddenly, the dragon heard someone punching through trees. He peered at the mysterious man and saw, Rocky Balboa. Rocky's senses tingled and he spun behind him, "Who's there!" "Oh it is just me Mr. Balboa! I am but a weak dragon, and I need your help!" Rocky looked into the sad eyes of the dragon, he knew he was telling the truth. The dragon told the whole tale to Rocky of the murdeous knight who slayed all of his friends. He took off his boxing gloves and shook the dragons hand swearing to train him. The dragon trained long and hard. ("Eye of the tiger" montage) He did everything that Rocky told him to do.

Finally, Rocky pronounced him ready to face Bill. The dragon confronted Bill and engaged in battle. Their fight lasted several days and several nights, however the dragon emerged victorious by using his fire breath to finish off Bill.The end
